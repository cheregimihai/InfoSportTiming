Handball Timekeeping App – Functional Specification (v0.1)

📱 Platform & Display
- Device: Android phone
- Orientation: Landscape only
- Mode: Fullscreen web app (React-based)
- Target User: Timekeeper

🕒 Match Timer
- Match duration: 2 x 30-minute halves (standard handball match)
- Display: 
  - Upper half: Large match timer, clearly visible
    - Format: MM:SS
    - Status: Running, Paused, Stopped, Half-time, Full-time

🎛️ Controls (Bottom Half of Screen)
- Time adjustment buttons:
  - -5 sec
  - -1 sec
  - Manual time input (via small modal or input field)
  - +1 sec
  - +5 sec
- Start / Pause toggle
- Reset Timer button (with confirmation)
- Controls should not be allowed to progress past 30:00 from times lower than 29:59 using the +1 sec,+5 sec.
- Controls should not be allowed to progress backwards from 30:00 from times lower than 30:01 using the -1 sec,-5 sec.
- Timer should stop at 30:00 and require that the user presses start to resume the count.

🔌 Automation
- Shelly Relay Integration (e.g. Shelly 1 or Shelly Plus 1)
  - Trigger at 30:00 (Half-time) → flash goal-side LED lights
  - Trigger at 60:00 (Full-time) → flash goal-side LED lights
  - Flash pattern: configurable later (e.g. 3 x 1 second blinks)

🧠 Memory/State Requirements
- Keep match time and relay state in memory during page reload or accidental exit (localStorage or sessionStorage)
- Configurable settings:
  - Flash duration/pattern
  - Shelly device IP/credentials
  - Option to disable relay control for test mode

🔧 Future Considerations
- Sound feedback on half/full-time (buzzer or notification)
- Optional third-party sync or backup (Firebase/local export)
- Offline-first support
- Referee interaction UI (penalties, timeouts, etc.)
- Permissions/lock to avoid accidental edits
- Dark mode for better visibility outdoors
